# Deployment Fix for React Context Error

## Problem
The error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createContext')` indicates that React is not being loaded properly in the production build.

## Solution

### 1. Updated Vite Configuration
The `vite.config.ts` has been updated with:
- Simplified chunk splitting to ensure React loads properly
- Removed complex manual chunking that could cause loading order issues
- Added proper global definitions
- Switched to terser minification for better compatibility

### 2. Added Polyfills
Created `src/polyfills.ts` to ensure React is available globally and handle any missing globals.

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
Updated `src/main.tsx` with:
- Global error handlers
- Fallback rendering without StrictMode
- Better error logging

## Deployment Steps

### For Local Testing:
1. Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force` (or use `sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm` to fix permissions)
2. Remove node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json`
3. Reinstall: `npm install`
4. Build: `npm run build`
5. Test locally: `npm run preview`

### For Production Deployment:

#### Option 1: Use the existing dist folder
The current `dist` folder should work with the fixes applied. Just deploy the contents of the `dist` folder.

#### Option 2: Rebuild with fixes
1. Apply the changes from this repository
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Deploy the new `dist` folder

### Key Files Changed:
- `vite.config.ts` - Simplified build configuration
- `src/polyfills.ts` - New polyfill file
- `src/main.tsx` - Enhanced error handling

### Deployment Platforms:
- **Vercel**: Deploy the `dist` folder or connect to GitHub
- **Netlify**: Deploy the `dist` folder or use continuous deployment
- **GitHub Pages**: Use the `dist` folder contents
- **Any static hosting**: Upload the `dist` folder contents

## Troubleshooting

If you still see the error:
1. Check browser console for additional errors
2. Ensure all files in `dist` are being served correctly
3. Check if there are any CORS issues
4. Verify that the hosting platform supports ES2015+ JavaScript

## Alternative Quick Fix

If the above doesn't work, you can also try:
1. Change the build target in `vite.config.ts` to `es5`
2. Add React as an external dependency and load it via CDN in `index.html`

The fixes provided should resolve the React context error in production builds.
