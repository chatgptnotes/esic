# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue: Custom Domain Warning
If you see "Your new Deployment will not be assigned any Custom Domains because auto-assigning custom production domains is disabled for this project", follow these steps:

### Solution 1: Enable Auto-assign Domains
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → Domains
3. Enable "Auto-assign production domains"
4. Redeploy the project

### Solution 2: Manual Domain Configuration
1. In Vercel project settings → Domains
2. Add your custom domain manually
3. Configure DNS settings as instructed by Vercel

### Environment Variables Required
Ensure these environment variables are set in Vercel:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: https://xvkxccqaopbnkvwgyfjv.supabase.co
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: [your supabase anon key]

### Build Configuration
The project uses Vite and should build automatically. If build fails:
1. Check that Node.js version is 18+ in Vercel settings
2. Verify build command is set to `npm run build`
3. Verify output directory is set to `dist`

### Testing the Refresh Functionality
The recent commit fixed refresh functionality in NoDeductionLetter page by:
- Bypassing React Query cache with direct Supabase calls
- Adding immediate state updates after data fetch
- Including comprehensive error handling and logging
- Adding 'Load Sample Data' button for testing

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Blank page after deployment
**Solution**: Check that all environment variables are properly set in Vercel dashboard.

#### Issue: Build fails with dependency errors
**Solution**: Ensure package.json includes all required dependencies and run `npm install` locally to verify.

#### Issue: Custom domain not working
**Solution**: Follow the domain configuration steps above and ensure DNS is properly configured.

### Debugging Steps
1. Check Vercel deployment logs for any build errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test the application locally with `npm run build && npm run preview`
4. Check browser console for any runtime errors
5. Verify Supabase connection is working properly
