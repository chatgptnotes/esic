# Junction Table Data Fetch Fix Summary

## Problem
Visit medical data (surgeons, consultants) was being saved to junction tables but not displayed on patient cards. The `patientDataTransformer` was setting all surgeon/consultant fields to 'Not assigned' as defaults.

## Root Cause
1. The `usePatients` hook was not fetching data from the junction tables
2. The `patientDataTransformer` was using hardcoded defaults instead of extracting junction table data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `usePatients` Hook (src/hooks/usePatients.ts)
Added junction table relationships to the query:
```typescript
visits(
  // ... existing fields ...
  visit_complications(
    complications(id, name)
  ),
  visit_esic_surgeons(
    esic_surgeons(id, name)
  ),
  visit_referees(
    referees(id, name)
  ),
  visit_hope_surgeons(
    hope_surgeons(id, name)
  ),
  visit_hope_consultants(
    hope_consultants(id, name)
  )
)
```

### 2. Updated `patientDataTransformer` (src/utils/patientDataTransformer.ts)
- Extract junction table data from each visit
- Use the extracted data instead of hardcoded defaults:
```typescript
// Extract medical data from junction tables
const complications = visit.visit_complications?.map(vc => vc.complications?.name).filter(Boolean) || [];
const esicSurgeons = visit.visit_esic_surgeons?.map(vs => vs.esic_surgeons?.name).filter(Boolean) || [];
const referees = visit.visit_referees?.map(vr => vr.referees?.name).filter(Boolean) || [];
const hopeSurgeons = visit.visit_hope_surgeons?.map(vhs => vhs.hope_surgeons?.name).filter(Boolean) || [];
const hopeConsultants = visit.visit_hope_consultants?.map(vhc => vhc.hope_consultants?.name).filter(Boolean) || [];

// Use in transformed patient object
complications: complications.length > 0 ? complications.join('; ') : 'None',
surgeon: esicSurgeons.length > 0 ? esicSurgeons.join(', ') : 'Not assigned',
consultant: referees.length > 0 ? referees.join(', ') : 'Not assigned',
hopeSurgeon: hopeSurgeons.length > 0 ? hopeSurgeons.join(', ') : 'Not assigned',
hopeConsultants: hopeConsultants.length > 0 ? hopeConsultants.join(', ') : 'Not assigned',
```

## Testing Results
- Confirmed junction tables contain data (1 ESIC surgeon record, 2 Hope consultant records)
- Verified nested query works correctly for patients with junction data
- Patient cards will now display saved surgeon/consultant data

## Important Notes
1. Most visits in the database don't have junction table data yet
2. Only visits with saved medical team data will show names instead of "Not assigned"
3. The `EditPatientDialog` already has the functionality to save to junction tables
4. Data saved through the edit dialog will now properly display on patient cards

## Next Steps
- No further code changes needed
- Users can add surgeon/consultant data through the Edit Patient dialog
- Saved data will automatically appear on patient cards
